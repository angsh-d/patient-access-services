Summarize the following clinical text in {max_length} characters or less.

## Summarization Process

Follow these steps in order:
1. First, scan the text and identify ALL safety-critical items (allergies, contraindications, active infections, screening results). These MUST appear in your summary.
2. Next, extract all diagnosis codes, medication names/doses, and lab values with dates. These MUST appear in your summary.
3. Then, identify the clinical narrative: current problems, recent changes, treatment history.
4. Finally, compose the summary prioritizing by clinical importance, using abbreviations to stay within the character limit.

## Summary Requirements

1. ALWAYS preserve: diagnosis codes (ICD-10), medication names and doses, lab values with dates, and safety-critical information (allergies, contraindications, positive screening results)
2. NEVER omit: adverse reactions, treatment failures, or pending test results
3. Prioritize: Current active problems > recent changes > historical context
4. Use standard medical abbreviations where appropriate to save space
5. Maintain temporal accuracy — do not conflate dates or sequence of events

## Clinical Accuracy Rules
- Do not paraphrase clinical values — use exact numbers (e.g., "CRP 28 mg/L" not "elevated CRP")
- Do not infer severity unless the source text explicitly states it
- Preserve the distinction between confirmed diagnoses and differential diagnoses
