Draft a professional {notification_type} notification.

Context:
{context}

Requirements:
- Professional and clear tone
- Include all relevant details for the intended recipient
- Actionable next steps if applicable
- MINIMUM NECESSARY STANDARD: Include only the minimum patient health information (PHI) required for the notification's purpose. Do not include:
  * Full social security numbers (use last 4 digits only if needed)
  * Detailed clinical histories beyond what is relevant to this notification
  * Financial information beyond what is directly relevant
- Use standard prior authorization terminology
- Include required identifiers: Member ID, authorization reference number, medication name
- Do NOT include: diagnosis details in patient-facing notifications (reference "your condition" or "your treatment" instead)
- **Anti-Hallucination**: Only include dates, authorization numbers, medication names, and deadlines that are explicitly provided in the context above. Do not fabricate reference numbers, dates, or contact information. Use placeholders like [AUTHORIZATION NUMBER] if data is missing.

## Notification Type Guidelines

If notification_type is:
- "approval_notification": Congratulatory tone, include authorization number, effective dates, any conditions
- "denial_notification": Empathetic but factual, include appeal rights and deadlines, avoid clinical jargon
- "information_request": Urgent but professional, specify exact documents needed, include submission deadline
- "status_update": Informational, include current status and expected next steps
- "appeal_acknowledgment": Confirm receipt, include timeline expectations

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example A: Information Request Notification (Correct)

Good notification:
"Dear Dr. Chen,

RE: Information Request -- Prior Authorization AUTH-2025-04421
Patient: Maria Rodriguez | Member ID: CIG-2847291

Cigna has requested additional documentation:
1. Fecal calprotectin lab result (most recent)
2. TB screening result (QuantiFERON or PPD, within 6 months)

Submission deadline: February 28, 2025

This request does not constitute a denial."

### Example B: Denial Notification (Patient-Facing -- PHI Minimization)

Good notification:
"Dear Ms. Rodriguez,

RE: Prior Authorization Update
Member ID: CIG-2847291

The prior authorization request for your prescribed treatment has not been approved at this time.

Your rights:
- You may file an internal appeal within [DAYS] days
- You may request a copy of the review criteria used
- You may request an expedited appeal if medically urgent"

Why correct: References "your prescribed treatment" instead of medication name or diagnosis (PHI minimization for patient-facing).

### Example C: BAD Notification (What NOT to Do)

"Dear Maria, Your prior auth for Humira (adalimumab 40mg SC q2w) for your Crohn's disease (ICD-10 K50.10) was denied. Your CRP was 28 and CDAI was 310. Good luck!"

WRONG because: Includes medication details, diagnosis code, and clinical data in patient-facing notification (violates PHI minimum necessary). No appeal rights. Unprofessional tone.
