Extract structured information from the following text according to the schema provided.

## Schema
{extraction_schema}

## Source Text
{text}

## Extraction Rules

1. Return valid JSON matching the schema exactly. Do not add fields not in the schema.
2. If the source text does not contain information for a schema field, set it to null. Do NOT fabricate or infer values.
3. If a field expects an array and no matching data exists, return an empty array [].
4. For date fields, normalize to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
5. For clinical codes (ICD-10, HCPCS, CPT), extract only codes explicitly present in the text.
6. Preserve exact clinical values (lab results, vital signs) without rounding or interpretation.

## Clinical Coding Guardrails

7. For ICD-10 codes, only extract codes that are valid billable codes. If a code appears malformed (e.g., extra digits, missing decimal), note it in a `coding_note` field.
8. For J-codes/HCPCS codes, extract exactly as written in the source. Add `coding_note` if the code does not match the expected format (J#### or Q####).
9. For NPI numbers, extract exactly 10 digits. Flag in `coding_note` if fewer or more digits are found.
10. Cross-reference medication names with J-codes when both appear in the source — note discrepancies in `coding_note`.

Respond with ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
