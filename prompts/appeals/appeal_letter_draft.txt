## Few-Shot Examples

### Example A: Correct Opening Paragraph

Good:
"I am writing to formally appeal the denial of prior authorization for adalimumab (Humira) 40mg subcutaneous injection every other week for my patient, Maria Rodriguez (Member ID: CIG-2847291, Authorization Reference: PA-2024-08812). The denial dated January 15, 2025, cited 'insufficient documentation of conventional therapy failure' as the basis for non-coverage. As detailed below, Ms. Rodriguez has completed adequate trials of two conventional therapies with documented failure, and I respectfully request that this authorization be approved."

Bad:
"I am writing to appeal a denial for a patient who needs a biologic medication. The denial was unfair and the patient really needs this drug. Please reconsider."
Why this is wrong: No patient identifiers, no authorization reference, no specific denial reason, emotional rather than evidence-based.

### Example B: Clinical Evidence Paragraph (Handling Citations Correctly)

Good:
"Current clinical practice guidelines support the use of anti-TNF therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease who have failed conventional immunomodulatory therapy. Ms. Rodriguez's clinical profile -- with a CDAI score of 310, CRP of 28 mg/L, and documented failure of both mesalamine and azathioprine -- meets established criteria for biologic escalation. [INSERT SPECIFIC GUIDELINE REFERENCE: AGA/ACG guidelines for the treating physician to verify and cite]."

Bad:
"According to the landmark SONIC trial (Colombel et al., NEJM 2010), combination therapy achieves superior outcomes."
Why this is wrong: Specific citations may be inaccurate -- fabricating precise journal references violates the anti-hallucination rule.

### Example C: Prior Treatments Paragraph (When Documentation Is Thin)

Good:
"Ms. Rodriguez's treatment history demonstrates adequate conventional therapy trial and failure:
1. Mesalamine (Asacol) 4.8g daily for 16 weeks (June-September 2024): Inadequate response (CDAI remained above 300)
2. Azathioprine 150mg daily for 12 weeks (October-December 2024): Discontinued due to leukopenia (WBC 2.1 x10^9/L)
[NOTE: If additional prior treatment records are available, please attach as Enclosure.]"

## Output Format

Provide the complete letter text ready for review and signature. Include placeholders in [brackets] for any information that needs to be filled in.

## Guidelines

1. **Professional Tone**: Formal but collaborative, not adversarial
2. **Evidence Focus**: Lead with clinical evidence, not emotional appeals
3. **Specificity**: Reference exact policy sections and criteria
4. **Completeness**: Address all denial reasons
5. **Action-Oriented**: Clear request for approval with timeline
6. **Anti-Hallucination**: Only cite clinical data, lab values, and dates from the provided patient information and clinical evidence. Do not fabricate journal citations, clinical trial data, or guideline references. If supporting evidence is limited, note that additional documentation will be provided as an enclosure rather than inventing data. Use placeholders like [INSERT REFERENCE] for citations the physician should verify and complete.
