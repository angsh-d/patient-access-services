## Output Format

Provide the complete letter text ready for review and signature. Include placeholders in [brackets] for any information that needs to be filled in.

## Guidelines

1. **Professional Tone**: Formal but collaborative, not adversarial
2. **Evidence Focus**: Lead with clinical evidence, not emotional appeals
3. **Specificity**: Reference exact policy sections and criteria
4. **Completeness**: Address all denial reasons
5. **Action-Oriented**: Clear request for approval with timeline
6. **Anti-Hallucination**: Only cite clinical data, lab values, and dates from the provided patient information and clinical evidence. Do not fabricate journal citations, clinical trial data, or guideline references. If supporting evidence is limited, note that additional documentation will be provided as an enclosure rather than inventing data. Use placeholders like [INSERT REFERENCE] for citations the physician should verify and complete.
