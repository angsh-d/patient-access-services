### CRITICAL: Compensating Factor Patterns Discovered
{compensating_factors}

**IMPORTANT**: The compensating factors above represent sophisticated patterns discovered through analysis of historical outcomes. These patterns show when one clinical factor (like disease severity) can compensate for missing documentation. THIS IS KEY INTELLIGENCE that experienced PA specialists learn through years of practice. Highlight these patterns prominently in your analysis.

### SAFETY OVERRIDE

CRITICAL: Compensating factors NEVER override SAFETY SCREENING requirements. The following can NEVER be compensated for, regardless of disease severity or other clinical factors:
- TB screening (required before all anti-TNF therapy)
- Hepatitis B screening
- Pregnancy testing (when applicable)
- Active serious infection screening

Compensating factors may apply to:
- Administrative documentation (timing of prior auth submission)
- Non-safety clinical documentation (disease activity scores when other severity markers are present)
- Step therapy documentation (when clinical contraindication to required prior therapy exists)

If a compensating factor pattern involves skipping safety screenings, explicitly note that the pattern should NOT be followed and recommend obtaining the safety screening.

## Your Task

Based on this historical intelligence, provide strategic recommendations for maximizing approval likelihood. Your analysis should include:

1. **Documentation Insights**: What documentation is missing that historically improves approval rates? What's the specific impact of adding each document?

2. **Payer-Specific Insights**: What requirements or patterns are specific to this payer? What triggers info requests or denials?

3. **Timing Recommendations**: When should this be submitted for optimal outcomes?

4. **Risk Factors**: What are the primary risks for this case based on historical patterns?

5. **Recommended Actions**: Prioritized list of actions to take, with expected impact on approval likelihood.

6. **Counterfactual Scenarios**: "If you do X, then Y" analysis showing how different actions would change outcomes.

7. **CRITICAL - Agentic Pattern Discovery**: If compensating factors are detected, provide ACTIONABLE recommendations. For example:
   - If TB screening is missing BUT disease severity is high → Advise submitting NOW with emphasis on severity markers
   - If step therapy is incomplete BUT physician attestation is present → Advise using step therapy exception pathway
   - This demonstrates true agentic reasoning: finding non-obvious patterns that maximize approval chances

## Statistical Integrity

When reporting percentages and statistics:
- Only cite statistics that can be directly computed from the historical data provided in {similar_cases_summary}
- If the sample size is below 10 cases, add a "LOW_SAMPLE_SIZE" warning
- If the sample size is below 5 cases, present as qualitative observations, not percentages
- Never fabricate or extrapolate statistics beyond what the provided data supports

Be specific with percentages, timelines, and rationale. Base all recommendations on the historical data provided. If the sample size is small, note limitations in confidence.
