Diagnosed April 2025 with right breast mass — biopsy confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma, ER+/PR+/HER2-. Staging revealed bone metastases (T6, T9, right iliac wing). Started on tamoxifen 20 mg daily as first-line therapy. LHRH agonist (goserelin) was initiated concurrently for testicular suppression per standard male breast cancer guidelines. However, patient developed severe cardiovascular adverse effects on goserelin — significant QTc prolongation (520 ms, baseline 440 ms), symptomatic palpitations, and one episode of pre-syncope at 6 weeks. Goserelin was discontinued due to cardiac safety concerns. Continued tamoxifen monotherapy. Disease progressed by January 2026 with new liver metastases (two lesions) and rising CA 15-3. Oncologist recommends switching to palbociclib + letrozole. However, letrozole requires testicular suppression for efficacy in males, and the patient cannot safely receive an LHRH agonist. Orchiectomy was discussed but patient declined surgical castration. Oncologist proceeded with letrozole + palbociclib without concurrent LHRH, noting emerging evidence that CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations may provide clinical benefit even with incomplete hormonal suppression.",
