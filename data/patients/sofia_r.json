      "clinical_significance": "Sofia represents a challenging policy gap for newborn screening programs. She was identified presymptomatically via NBS — the entire purpose of which is early treatment. While 4 SMN2 copies correlate with milder SMA phenotypes (Type 3/4), research (NURTURE trial) shows presymptomatic treatment yields the best outcomes regardless of SMN2 copy number. The policy rationale is that higher SMN2 copy counts predict milder disease that may not benefit as significantly from early intervention, but this 'wait and see' approach contradicts the established benefit of presymptomatic treatment in SMA.",
      "potential_appeal_basis": "Strong medical necessity appeal: (1) NURTURE trial data showing presymptomatic treatment benefit across all SMN2 copy numbers, (2) SMA Foundation consensus guidelines recommending treatment for all genetically confirmed SMA regardless of copy number, (3) Irreversible motor neuron loss occurs before symptoms appear — denying treatment while waiting for symptom onset causes permanent damage, (4) Risdiplam (Evrysdi) as alternative if Spinraza denied, (5) Genotype-phenotype correlation is imperfect — some patients with 4 SMN2 copies develop SMA Type 2 (intermediate) rather than the predicted milder Type 3."
